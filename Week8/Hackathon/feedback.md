Revised Feedback on the Project

Data Cleaning:
Nice work on cleaning up those missing values and renaming columns for better clarity. Also, great addition with the renaming step in your data cleaning process.
18/20

Feature Engineering:
You've done a solid job on filtering and transforming the data, like getting those dates in the right format and filtering based on specific conditions. For the future, consider diving into some more advanced feature engineering techniques like one-hot encoding. But great job nontheless! 
17/20

Data Analysis:
Your data analysis is on point with clear and informative visualizations. The pie charts, scatter plots, and histograms you've used do a great job at showing what's going on with the data. Throw in some more diverse types of analysis next time for even deeper insights.
18/20

Concluded Insights:
You've done a fantastic job at drawing insights from your analysis and presenting them in a way that's easy to understand. The insights from sentiment analysis and keyword searches are particularly well made in your presentation slides. It's was very nice how you've laid everything out so clearly in the PowerPoint slides, making it super easy for anyone to get the gist of your findings.
17/20

Use of Machine Learning:
You've shown some great skills in applying sentiment analysis tools and data visualization techniques to get an understanding on customer feedback. Your use of TF-IDF and sentiment analysis tools shows you've got a good handle on NLP techniques. Maybe next time, consider exploring some more complex machine learning models or tuning the existing ones to boost accuracy.
